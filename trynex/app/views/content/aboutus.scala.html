                            <h4>Trynex is India's most advanced digital exchange</h4>
                            <p>It's the first complete exchange supporting multiple cryptocurrencies/ tokens on a single platform. Built entirely from scratch, Trynex is aimed at bringing the magic of blockchain technology to India. Bitcoin - the world's first cryptocurrency - was introduced in 2009 and since then over 1000 tradable tokens have come into existence. However, for a long time India missed out on the tremendous opportunity that the rest of the world had been enjoying and Trynex has been built to to bridge that gap.</p>
                            <p>Trynex has been built over cutting edge technology. Proprietary trading engine, wallet and platform architectures, grade A security, user-centric UI/UX, and tons of user-demanded features are some of the things which define Trynex. It's being carved to perfection, one day at a time, all with your constant love and support.</p>
