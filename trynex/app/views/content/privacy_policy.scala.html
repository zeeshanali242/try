You acknowledge that, when a Transaction is entered, TRYNEX sends and receives Crypto Currencies from the buyer’s and the seller’s respective Accounts.</p>
<p>It is your responsibility and you undertake to ensure that you hold sufficient Fiat Currency and/or Tokens in its Account to meet your settlement obligations and any other liabilities arising from any Transaction, including Fees payable on the Account.</p>
<p>You represent and warrants that:</p>
<ul>

<li>you are duly authorized and has the capacity to provide each Instruction and enter into each Transaction on TRYNEX;</li>

<li>your use of TRYNEX, provision of Instructions or entering any Transaction does not infringe the rights of any third party or any applicable law.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>use TRYNEX to perform any illegal activity of any sort, including, but not limited to, money laundering or terrorism financing; or</li>
<li>use TRYNEX to perform payment of any ransomware, including, but not limited to cryptolocker; or</li>
<li>give any Instruction or enter any Transaction or do or undertake any other activity, whether or not through TRYNEX, which would or may negatively affect the performance of the Platform or the reputation of the Company.</li>

<ul>
<li>The value of Crypto Currency may rise or fall</li>
<li>The value of Crypto Currency will be affected by factors outside of the control of TRYNEX</li>
<li>The value of Crypto Currency may be affected by other alternative Crypto Currencies being created or developed or other forms of Crypto Currencies or similar commodities being developed</li>
<li>Crypto Currencies may not be transferrable or accepted for transfer by any third party</li>
<li>Crypto Currencies may not be accepted as payment for goods and services by any person</li>

</ul>
<p>You are responsible for any tax liability arising from its holding or Transactions in Crypto Currencies and will indemnify the Company where the Company is obliged to pay tax on behalf of you in respect of your Account or any Crypto Currencies held, or bought or sold by you.</p>

<h5>Risks</h5>
<p>The trading of goods and products, real or virtual, as well as virtual currencies involves significant risk. Prices can and do fluctuate on any given day. Due to such price fluctuations, you may increase or lose value in your assets at any given moment. Any currency or commodities - virtual or not - may be subject to large swings in value and may even become worthless. There is an inherent risk that losses will occur as a result of buying, selling or trading anything on a market.</p>
<p>TRYNEX cannot cancel or reverse any Crypto-to-Crypto Transactions, as long as they are accepted and confirmed on the blockchain network. Once submitted to the blockchain network, Crypto Transactions are subject to verification for a period of time, awaiting confirmation by the blockchain network. A Transaction is not complete until this verification has been complete, and Transactions will not be reflected in your TRYNEX crypto balance until complete.</p>
<p>Crypto Currencies trading also has special risks not generally shared with official currencies or goods or commodities in a market. Unlike most currencies, which are backed by governments or other legal entities, or by commodities such as gold or silver, Crypto is a unique kind of currency, based by technology and trust. There is no central bank that can take corrective measure to protect the value of Crypto Currencies in a crisis or issue more currency.</p>
<p>Instead, Crypto is an as-yet autonomous and largely unregulated worldwide system of currency firms and individuals. Traders put their trust in a digital, decentralised and partially anonymous system that relies on peer-to-peer networking and cryptography to maintain its integrity.</p>
<p>Crypto Currency trading is probably susceptible to irrational (or rational) bubbles or loss of confidence, which could collapse demand relative to supply. For example, confidence might collapse in Bitcoin outside factors within Bitcoin such as a government crackdown, the creation of superior competing alternative currencies, or a deflationary or inflationary spiral. Confidence might also collapse because of factors within Bitcoin such as technical problems. IE: If the integrity of the system is compromised, if money is lost or stolen, or if hackers or governments are able to prevent any Transactions from settling.</p>
<p>There may be additional risks that we have not foreseen or identified in our Terms of Use.</p>
<p>You should carefully assess whether your financial situation and tolerance for risk is suitable for buying, selling or trading Crypto Currencies.</p>

<h5>Disclaimer</h5>
<p>TRYNEX does not provide financial advice in any form. No content, services, or products available on our Website or via any form of communication may be taken as financial advice or a financial recommendation. Please speak with your financial advisor for all matters related to purchases, trade or sale of Crypto Currencies or volatile goods and/or commodities. We do not recommend anything available on the Website as an investment. It is possible that you can lose some or all of the money you spend on any product available at TRYNEX due to price and/or value fluctuations.</p>

<h5>Security</h5>
<p>TRYNEX takes a comprehensive approach to security. Our security experts have built in a number of sophisticated measures to prevent the theft of money or information. Theft isn't the only threat of course. It's also essential that a professional exchange offer financial stability, with full reserves, healthy banking relationships and the highest standards of legal compliance.</p>

<p>Described below are just some of our security practices. The list is not complete — you can be assured that our security measures go well beyond what we're willing to make public.</p>


<h5>Coin Storage</h5>
<ul>
<li>All new deposits go directly to cold wallets, with complete air-gap isolation from any online system.</li>
<li>The vast majority of coins are stored in cold wallets, with complete air-gap isolation from any online system.</li>
<li>A limited number of coins are stored in semi-cold wallets, on protected machines with locked drives.</li>
<li>Only the coins that are needed to maintain operational liquidity are stored in hot (online) wallets.</li>
<li>All wallets are encrypted.</li>


</ul>

<h5>User Account Security</h5>
<ul>
<li>Two-factor authentication is available for account login and funding, trading, and actions that can be performed using API keys.</li>
<li>A separate two-factor authentication channel (Master Key) can be enabled for highly secure account recovery.</li>
<li>Protection against leakage of user information: login or password recovery attempts will not reveal any account information, including the existence of an account.</li>
<li>Isolated, highly secure system for uploading account verification documents.</li>
<li>All sensitive account information, including verification documents, is encrypted and access to multiple highly secure systems is required to decrypt it.</li>
<li>Global settings lock that can be enabled to prevent tampering of user account information, including withdrawal addresses, by an attacker who has gained access to the account.</li>
</ul>

<h5>System Security</h5>
<ul>
<li>TRYNEX's servers reside in locked racks, in a locked private cage, inside a top-tier professional data center: this means armed guards, video surveillance, retina scans, the works.</li>
<li>Data is encrypted wherever possible, and systems are both redundant and isolated from one another.</li>
<li>Data is replicated in real time and backed up on a daily basis.</li>
<li>We currently use Cloudflare, among other measures, for protection from Distributed Denial of Service attacks.</li>
<li>Our office is wired with separate networks for separate purposes. The system our agents use to access your uploaded account verification documents cannot be used for anything else. Support tickets are on a completely separate system, and so on.</li>
<li>Our staff has been thoroughly reviewed, and multiple sign-offs are required for anything remotely sensitive.</li>

</ul>

<h5>Financial Security</h5>
<ul>
<li>We maintain full reserves — a "bank run" is an impossibility.</li>
<li>Customer funds reside in a bank account separate from our operations account, and fees are transferred on a daily basis.</li>
<li>Customer funds cannot be borrowed to fund operations, nor can they be lent, even for margin trading on our own platform.</li>
<li>We have solid relations with our bank, and an agreement is in place allowing us to wind down our account in an orderly fashion, should our relationship ever come to an end.</li>
<li>We are pursuing multiple banking partnerships to build in some financial redundancy — so that even should the above situation come to pass, our daily operations will not be interrupted.</li>
</ul>

<h5>Legal Compliance</h5>
<ul>
<li>Crypto legal status is still being defined, but TRYNEX takes a highly proactive and informed approach to ensuring legal compliance.</li>
<li>Our approach is to operate conservatively, entirely within the bounds of current law, and to constantly monitor regulatory developments so that we can anticipate changes before they occur.</li>
<li>Our compliance measures are designed by a five-member team of legal advisors, including a full-time General Counsel who is responsible for constantly evaluating our legal stance in the face of regulatory</li>
</ul>
